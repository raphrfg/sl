~~SL(1): Cure your bad habit of mistyping~~ This fork was really just a joke I made at an old job, leaving it out of sentiment...
=======================================

~~SL (Steam Locomotive) runs across your terminal when you type "sl" as
you meant to type "ls". It's just a joke command, and not useful at
all.~~ basically, it just adds a new ascii art which is so low quality I didn't even PR it.
